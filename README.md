DoD-PointCloud-CrossSections is a Python/ArcGIS-based tool designed to streamline the extraction of cross-sections from 3D point cloud-derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). 
It enables researchers and engineers to quantify landscape changes, monitor erosion, settlement, or other topographic deformations over time, using a Difference of DEMs (DoD) approach.
This tool is particularly suited for geomatics, mining, and civil engineering applications where accurate detection of terrain change is critical.
